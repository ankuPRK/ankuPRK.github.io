At SRIB currently I'm leading a team of 'intrapreneurs' under SRIB's C-Lab initiative. <br>
Prior to that I worked in the Samsung-Keyboard team in Multimedia Depth Technology <br>

<p>I graduated from <a href="www.iitk.ac.in">IIT Kanpur</a> with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering in 2017, where <br>
I worked as an Undergraduate-Researcher at Signal and Multimedia Processing Lab (SiMPL), <br>

<p>
My research interests lie in Computer Vision, Image and Video processing, Multimedia content <br>

can be utilized to solve important problems in India.
