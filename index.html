  <h1>Prakhar Kulshreshtha</h1>
  <p>Research Engineer, <a href="https://research.samsung.com/sri-b">Samsung R&D Institute India-Bangalore (SRIB)</a> </p>

  <p>  
I'm currently leading a team of 'intrapreneurs' under SRIB's C-Lab initiative. <br>
Prior to that I worked in the Samsung-Keyboard team in Multimedia Depth Technology <br>
division in  Advanced Technology Labs (ATL).</p>

<p>I graduated from <a href="https://www.iitk.ac.in">IIT Kanpur</a> with a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering in 2017, where <br>
I worked as an Undergraduate-Researcher at Signal and Multimedia Processing Lab (SiMPL), <br>
headed by <a href="http://tanayag.com/Home.html">Prof. Tanaya Guha</a>. </p>

<p>
My research interests lie in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Image and Video processing,
<br>
Multimedia content analysis and Online Learning. Going forward I would like to build <br>
intelligent solutions which can impact people's lives in a positive way. I'm especially <br>
fascinated by utilization of technology to solve important problems in India.</p>
